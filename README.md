# Intro_to_Me
Hello! I am an Entry Level Software Developer with experience in: 
  Java, Python, MERN, MySQL, Spring Tools, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstraps. 

I was self-learning HTML, CSS, and JS two years ago and finally went full speed ahead from their when I became a student at Coding Dojo BootCamp. From there I graduated in December 2021 and have further my learning in development and have experted three full stacks of languages. I'm excited to be where I am now and my further push towards the future in a development career. 

What got me into coding was the diversity of career paths it has and the constant need to learn and train. I love learning and with that I like the ability of being creative with it too. Coding is complex and with that it holds many possiblities. As the world steadily moves towards the future it can be seen that coding will be a big factor to how we shape it and become better all around.
